# A Question and Answer Bot Using Amazon Lex and Amazon Alexa

> Build a chat bot to answer questions. 

## Overview
This repository contains code for the QnABot, described in the AWS AI blog post [“Creating a Question and Answer Bot with Amazon Lex and Amazon Alexa”](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/ai/creating-a-question-and-answer-bot-with-amazon-lex-and-amazon-alexa/).

See the "Getting Started" to launch your own QnABot,

## Prerequisites

- Run Linux. (tested on Amazon Linux)
- Install npm >5 and node >8. ([instructions](https://nodejs.org/en/download/))
- Clone this repo.
- Set up an AWS account. ([instructions](https://AWS.amazon.com/free/?sc_channel=PS&sc_campaign=acquisition_US&sc_publisher=google&sc_medium=cloud_computing_b&sc_content=AWS_account_bmm_control_q32016&sc_detail=%2BAWS%20%2Baccount&sc_category=cloud_computing&sc_segment=102882724242&sc_matchtype=b&sc_country=US&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!102882724242!b!!g!!%2BAWS%20%2Baccount&ef_id=WS3s1AAAAJur-Oj2:20170825145941:s))
- Configure AWS CLI and a local credentials file. ([instructions](http://docs.AWS.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html))  

Note: Lex is currently only supported in the us-east-1 and eu-west-1 regions.

## Getting Started
First, install all prerequisites:
```shell
npm install 
```

Next, set up your configuration file:

```shell
npm run config
```

now edit config.json with you information.

| param | description | 
|-------|-------------|
|region | the AWS region to launch stacks in |
|profile| the AWS credential profile to use |
|namespace| a logical name space to run your templates in such as dev, test and/or prod |
|devEmail(required) | the email to use when creating admin users in automated stack launches |

Next, use the following command to launch a CloudFormation template to create the S3 bucket to be used for lambda code and CloudFormation templates. Wait for this template to complete (you can watch progress from the command line or [AWS CloudFormation console](https://console.AWS.amazon.com/cloudformation/home))  
```shell
npm run bootstrap
```

Finally, use the following command to launch template to deploy the QnA bot in your AWS account. When the stack has completed you will be able to log into the Designer UI (The URL is an output of the template). A temporary password to the email in your config.json:
```shell
npm run up
```

If you have an existing stack you can run the following to update your stack:
```shell 
npm run update
```

## Components
### CloudFormation Templates
The CloudFormation test templates are in the templates/test folder. The current templates are:

1. Master: the template contains all the resources for QnABot.
2. Public: this is a version of the Master template with less parameters, less outputs, and the bootstrap bucket hardcoded to the publicBucket in config.json
3. various templates in /templates/dev: needed for local testing of the lambda functions. 

Run a template test with:
```shell
npm run stack test/{template-name}
```

For example, if you want to test the domain template run:
```shell
npm run stack test/domain
```

To understand the command more run: 
```shell 
npm run stack -h
```

You also can check a template's syntax with:
```shell
npm run check {template-name}
```
ex. 
```shell
npm run check domain
```

To understand the command more run: 
```shell 
npm check stack -h
```

### Lambda Functions
Lambda functions are found in the /lambda directory. Refer to the README.md file in each directory for instructions on setting up a dev environment and testing. 
[Fulfillment](lambda/fulfillment/README.md)
[CFN](lambda/handler/README.md)
[Lex-Build](lambda/lex-build/README.md)
[Import](lambda/import/README.md)

### Web Interface
The Designer UI and client UI code is in the /website directory. 

To Test the web ui, Launch a development master stack:
```shell
npm run stack dev/master up
```
when that stack has finished run:
```shell
cd ./website ; make dev
```
this will launch a running webpack process that will watch for changes to files and upload the changes to your running dev/master stack. 

#### Designer UI Compatibility 
Currently the only browsers supported are:  
- Chrome  
- FireFox  
We are currently working on adding Microsoft Edge support.
