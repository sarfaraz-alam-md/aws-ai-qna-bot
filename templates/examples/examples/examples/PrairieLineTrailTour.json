              "markdown": "This feature's main practical function is to treat stormwater. In an urban environment, stormwater picks up pollutants. Rain gardens like this one use special plants to filter out pollution before runoff hits major waterways. This rain garden treats stormwater from 42 acres of developed urban space upstream, making sure that water is clean and safe when it joins the Thea Foss Waterway at the bottom of the hill.\n\n Learn more about the Prairie Line Trail Stormwater Treatment: https://www.tacoma.uw.edu/news/article/how-it-works-prairie-line-trail-stormwater-treatment . \n\n Artfully designed to work with the existing railroad tracks, the rain garden also preserves a key piece of Tacoma's history. A close look at the rusty track segments reveals dates. These dates show the last time the tracks were swapped out for maintenance reasons. The last train rumbled over the Prairie Line tracks in Tacoma on the afternoon of March 30, 2003, just under fifty years after these rails were last replaced."
